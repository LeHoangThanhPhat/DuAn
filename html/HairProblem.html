                    <h1>What Are the Four Stages of Hair Growth?</h1>
The growth and loss of hair may seem like a simple process, but the hair growth cycle is actually composed of four distinct phases. These stages of hair growth have been studied in great depth to better understand how hair grows and what might be done to prevent or treat premature hair loss.

Each phase has its own timeline, which can be affected by age, nutrition, and overall health. That means there are steps you can take along the way to help ensure that your hair follows a healthy growth cycle. Read on to learn more.<br><br><br>

            Hair loss can appear in many different ways, depending on what's causing it. It can come on suddenly or gradually and affect just your scalp or your whole body. Signs and symptoms of hair loss may include.....</li><br><br><br>

                <h1>Why Hair Turns Gray?</h1>
It is normal for hair color to change, as people age. But white hair can appear at almost any time in life. Even teenagers and people in their 20s may notice strands of white hair. The human body has millions of hair follicles or small sacs lining the skin. The follicles generate hair and color or pigment cells that contain melanin. Over time, hair follicles lose pigment cells, resulting in white hair color.

In this article, we look at some common causes of prematurely white hair, along with ways to slow the graying process down or prevent it, in some instances.<br><br><br>

It’s normal to lose about 100 strands of hair from your head a day. But losing more could mean that your hair is beginning to thin, and it's time to consult a dermatologist. Typically, we think of balding as a condition that plagues older men, but there are many types and causes of hair loss that can happen to anyone, regardless of your age or gender, anytime.

            <h2>I.Make Your Hair Growth Faster</h2><br>
            There are a lot of factors that contribute to hair growth (or lack thereof), but one of the most overlooked is physical stimulation—as in massaging the heck out of your scalp. Turns out giving yourself a scalp massage using some key natural ingredients can help your hair grow faster and, in turn, make your strands look more Blake Lively–esque.<br>
            There’s also the whole egg-yolk-mask thing, and let’s not forget the sworn-by hot castor oil treatment. With plenty of natural treatment options, achieving the hair of your dreams doesn’t have to feel so far-fetched. Just remember, there isn’t an ingredient or method that can actually make your hair grow faster from the root. Instead, you’ll want to follow the tips below to grow healthier, stronger hair that will reduce breakage at the ends and, in turn, promote length.<br>
            To help us figure out how to make hair grow faster, we hit up the pros. Keep scrolling for some simple and natural ways to encourage faster hair growth.<br><br><br><br>

                <li></li>
                <li>
                    <img src="/Picture/scalpmassage.jpg" alt="">
                </li>
                <li>We spend so much time and money piling on hair products that it’s easy to forget where hair growth starts: namely, your scalp. "Just like good-quality soil is essential to grow healthy plants and flowers, a healthy scalp is the foundation for healthy hair growth," says Bauman. "Research supports the idea that a scalp massage has beneficial effects on stress hormones, blood pressure, and heart rate."

                    A simple way to stimulate hair growth at home is to give yourself a scalp massage. This will increase blood flow to your scalp, enhance the strength of your roots, and help nutrients get to your follicle faster. You can give yourself a scalp massage with dry hair, but adding a nutrient-rich oil to the mix will only double the benefits. (Just keep it to once a week if you have oily roots).</li>

                <li> <h3>02. Try an Egg Yolk Mask</h3></li>
                <li></li>

                </li>
                <li>Try an Egg Yolk Mask egg mask STOCKSY Bauman notes that, on average, hair grows approximately a quarter to a half an inch per month, and while we can’t speed up this process, we can affect the quality of the hair shafts each follicle can produce (think: thicker, stronger, shinier locks).
                    There are things we can do to "stimulate a higher percentage of hair follicles in the scalp, which will keep more hair in the growing phase and make your head of hair thicker, healthier and fuller." Unsurprisingly, this makes how you treat your hair crucial to natural hair growth. If your hair breaks before it gets past your shoulders, an egg yolk mask will be your savior.
                    To make the mask, mix 2 eggs with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add 1/2 a cup of water to dilute the mixture (and make it less sticky). Apply the mask directly to dry, brushed hair, and leave it on for up to 30 minutes. Then, shampoo and condition as usual.</li>

                        A silk or satin hair cover or pillowcase is better for the health of your hair than cotton, which will absorb all the moisture from your strands and lead to tangles and breakage. While this won’t necessarily speed up the hair growth process, sleeping on a silk pillowcase generates less friction and gives hair a softer surface to rest on.

Celebrities use them. Instagrammers love them. Hair stylists recommend them. Silk pillowcases are not new, but over the past couple of years, they seem to have exploded in popularity, embraced by the beauty and wellness industries and credited with delivering smooth, shiny hair and wrinkle-free, supple skin.

            <h2>II.Natural Remedies To Reduce White (Gray) Hair</h2><br>
            Whether or not hair graying can be reversed to help white hair turn black largely depends on the cause of graying. If genetics are responsible, there is not much one can do to reverse the change.

If the cause is an underlying health problem, consulting a doctor to see what can be done is the best course of action. Once the problem is treated, it may help restore pigment to your hair. However, this cannot be guaranteed.

Re-pigmentation is sometimes possible after hormone therapy treatment. Another way to promote pigmentation is by taking shots or pills of vitamin B12. You can also try the natural remedies mentioned below and know how to reduce white hair.<br><br><br>
